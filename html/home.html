            <h1>Sri Lanka</h1>
            <p>A myriad of cultures, religions, landscapes, climates, and food, Sri Lanka feels like countless countries
                rolled into one. Because of this, travelers can experience an incredible diversity in landscapes within
                a
                short space of time. Travel among dusty plains, luscious tropical mountain regions, heavenly coastline,
                spectacular bushlands, and bustling cities. Wherever the path leads, it will fill even the weariest of
                travelers with unadulterated excitement and joy.
            </p><br><br><br>

            <h1>Adventure of a Lifetime</h1>
            <p>Sri Lanka is all about exhilarating adventure. Hike at dawn to the peak of Lion’s Rock, for epic views of
                the valleys and elephants below. Experience the unforgettable sight of a leopard sleeping in the trees
                in
                Yala, or experience the ferocity of the waves while learning to surf in Mirissa. The adventure doesn’t
                stop
                here though. Sri Lanka is all about the journey, not just the destination. Pass through stunning tea
                plantations by train, as the wind hits your face in an open carriage. Go off-roading in a jeep along
                long
                stretches of rippled sand, or cycle on twisting paths through beautiful palm tree forests.
            </p><br><br><br>

            <h1>Relax, Smile, Refresh</h1>
            <p>The feeling of contentment and peace is everywhere in Sri Lanka. Relax the body and mind in one of the
                many
                yoga retreats, swing in a beach bar hammock with a delicious coconut, or paddle in the warm shallows of
                the
                turquoise sea. Sri Lanka truly lives up to its name as ‘the pearl of the Indian Ocean’, showcasing
                world-class natural beauty, plant life, and wildlife. Not only this but also world-famous sites,
                unparalleled in their beauty and history. The infinite kindness of this country, and its joyful people,
                is not to be missed!
